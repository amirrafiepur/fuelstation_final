Purchase views: choosing a working date (reuses the same chronology rules
as sales -- rule 10) to enter a purchase for a tank/product (rule 1: any
number of these per day), plus a date-range purchase list -- two separate
tables, Regular and Super -- with a combined print button, mirroring the
Nozzle Performance and Petroleum Ledger report sections' UI/workflow.

No business math lives here -- only orchestration of purchases/services.py
and workday/services.py, per rule 9.
