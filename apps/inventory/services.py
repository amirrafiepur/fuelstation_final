inventory/services.py -- tank inventory calculations.

Circularity rule (see architecture doc §"IMPORTANT INVENTORY CIRCULARITY
RULE"): a day's Overage/Shortage must NEVER feed into that same day's own
Total Inventory. Only the PREVIOUS working day's Overage is used as an
input. This day's own Overage becomes tomorrow's "Previous Overage".

For day 1 of the first accounting month there is no previous working day,
so Previous Balance comes from OpeningInventory (0 by default, or a
user-supplied value) and Previous Overage is 0.
