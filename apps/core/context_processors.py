"""
Template context available on every page, not just views that explicitly
build it -- this is what makes the header's date selector and license
badge genuinely global instead of dashboard-only. Registered in
config/settings/base.py's TEMPLATES["OPTIONS"]["context_processors"].

Kept deliberately tiny: this only reads already-computed state from
workday/license services, never any accounting logic of its own.
